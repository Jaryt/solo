# Terraform - Infrastructure

## Create infrastructure
1. `terraform init -backend-config=infrastructure-stage.config`
    * Initializes the backend to the s3 bucket
1. `terraform validate`
    * Syntactically valid and internally consistent,
    regardless of any provided variables or existing state
1. `tflint`
    * Linter the terraform files
1. `terraform plan -var-file=infrastructure-stage.tfvars`
    * Checks whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches
    your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state
1. `terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=infrastructure-stage.tfvars`
    * Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration,
    or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan
    * `-auto-approve` flag is utilized so a user does not have to manually enter yes
### Check AWS console for created resources:
    * vpc
    * public/private subnets
    * public/private route tables
    * associated public/private subnets to public/private route tables
    * internet gateway (igw)
    * update public route table with igw
    * network address translation (nat) gateway
    * associate private route table with nat gw
